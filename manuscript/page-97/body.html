I felt as if the clouds had rolled away and all was as it used to be. I felt like one of those chappies in the novels who calls off the fight with his wife in the last chapter and decides to forget and forgive. I felt I wanted to do all sorts of other things to show Jeeves that I appreciated him.</p><p>"Jeeves," I said, "it isn't enough. Is there anything else you would like?"</p><p>"Yes, sir. If I may make the suggestionâ€”fifty dollars."</p><p>"Fifty dollars?"</p><p>"It will enable me to pay a debt of honour, sir. I owe it to his lordship."</p></div> </div>
