And then a chair falling over.</p><p>"There's somebody in the dining-room," I whispered.</p><p>There's a certain type of chap who takes a pleasure in positively chivvying trouble. Old Bill's like that. If I had been alone, it would have taken me about three seconds to persuade myself that I hadn't really heard anything after all. I'm a peaceful sort of cove, and believe in living and letting live, and so forth. To old Bill, however, a visit from burglars was pure jam. He was out of his chair in one jump.</p><p>"Come on," he said. "Bring the poker."</p><p>I brought the tongs as well. I felt like it. Old Bill collared the knife. We crept downstairs.</p><p>"We'll fling the door open and make a rush," said Bill.</p><p>"Supposing they shoot, old scout?"</p><p>"Burglars never shoot," said Bill.</p></div> </div>
