Give a month's notice and get your 'at, and I'll take you to dinner at Ciro's."</p><p>"And you, Mr. Lattaker," said the Count, "may I conduct you to the presence of my high-born master? He wishes to show his gratitude to his preserver."</p><p>"You may," said George. "May I have my hat, Mr. Sturgis?"</p><p>There's just one bit more.
