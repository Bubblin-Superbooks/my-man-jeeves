Who's to say you aren't Alfred if you swear you are? Your uncle will be there to back you up that you have a brother Alfred."</p><p>"And Alfred will be there to call me a liar."</p><p>"He won't. It's not as if you had to keep it up for the rest of your life. It's only for an hour or two, till we can get this detective off the yacht. We sail for England to-morrow morning."</p><p>At last the thing seemed to sink into him. His face brightened.</p><p>"Why, I really do believe it would work," he said.</p><p>"Of course it would work. If they want proof, show them your mole. I'll swear George hadn't one."</p><p>"And as Alfred I should get a chance of talking to Stella and making things all right for George. Reggie, old top, you're a genius."</p></div> </div>
