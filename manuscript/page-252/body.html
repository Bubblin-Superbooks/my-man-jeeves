It ran like this:</p><p>"MY DEAR OLD REGGIE,—What ages it seems since I saw anything of you. How are you? We have settled down here in the most perfect old house, with a lovely garden, in the middle of delightful country. Couldn't you run down here for a few days? Clarence and I would be so glad to see you. Bill is here, and is most anxious to meet you again. He was speaking of you only this morning. <em>Do</em> come. Wire your train, and I will send the car to meet you.</p><p>——Yours most sincerely,<br>ELIZABETH YEARDSLEY.</p></div> </div>
