To get the kid undressed had been simpleâ€”a mere matter of muscle. But how were we to get him into his clothes again? I stirred the pile with my foot.

Women are wonderful, by George they are! She had that kid dressed and looking fit for anything in about eight minutes. I showered wealth on her, and she promised to come in morning and evening. I sat down to breakfast almost cheerful again. It was the first bit of silver lining there had been to the cloud up to date.</p></div> </div>
